dots files for my personal vim config and bash aliases

to install the vim plugins run `git submodule update --init --recursive`

the youcompleteme plugin requires a few dependencies as noted [here](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/youcompleteme)

<pre>git clone https://github.com/fuseteam/dotfiles</pre> to fetch my dotfiles after you can move the files you want to use to your home directory
the exp branch is a version without my .bash_aliases
